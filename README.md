I'm Kailey Hua (she/her), a student at Proof School (co2023) in San Francisco, California.

(Public) FRC code repositories: [`frc2020 (1868)`](https://github.com/team1868/frc2020)

I worked on a project to produce a [computational model of a simplified mammalian respiratory central pattern generator](https://github.com/kaileyhh/RISE-cpg-model/blob/main/group_k_POSTER.pdf) and model the effects of stimuli on specific complexes & create a modified version of a Hindmarsh-Rose neuron with a new differential equation for a modulation valuable, all of the code can be found in [`RISE-cpg-model`](https://github.com/kaileyhh/RISE-cpg-model) and the general code from labs from RISE can be found in [`rise2022 `](https://github.com/kaileyhh/rise2022)

All my research from Proof School's annual math bursts can be found in [`mathburst`](https://github.com/kaileyhh/mathburst)
